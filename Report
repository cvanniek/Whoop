# WHOOP Data Analysis: Health and Performance Optimization

## Project Overview
This project leverages physiological data from WHOOP wearables to analyze and optimize health and performance outcomes. By examining the impact of factors like sleep, strain, heart rate variability, and temperature on recovery and sleep quality, this analysis provides actionable insights for improving overall wellness and athletic performance. Advanced data science methods, including A/B testing, feature engineering, and machine learning, were used to understand and predict recovery and performance outcomes.

## Project Objectives
1. **Identify Patterns and Correlations**: Examine the relationship between sleep, strain, temperature, and recovery to identify factors that impact athletic performance and health.
2. **Perform Hypothesis Testing**: Conduct A/B tests to determine whether variables like strain level and sleep duration significantly impact recovery and sleep performance.
3. **Build Predictive Models**: Train machine learning models to predict recovery scores and sleep quality based on physiological and activity data.
4. **Communicate Findings**: Use interactive visualizations and statistical summaries to make findings accessible and actionable for various stakeholders.

## Data Processing
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Data from WHOOP wearables was loaded, and missing values were addressed to ensure data consistency.
2. **Date-Time Formatting**: Columns like `"Cycle start time"` were formatted into datetime objects, enabling month-based segmentation and time-based analysis.
3. **Segmentation**: Data was segmented by month and strain levels to facilitate month-by-month comparison and A/B testing.

## Feature Engineering
1. **Interaction and Polynomial Features**: Created new features by introducing interaction terms (e.g., `Strain * Sleep Duration`) and polynomial terms (e.g., `Sleep Duration^2`) to capture nonlinear relationships.
2. **Feature Scaling**: Standardized features to prepare data for machine learning models, ensuring consistency and improving model performance.
3. **New Metrics**: Engineered additional metrics such as “sleep consistency” and calculated average weekly metrics to capture long-term trends in physiological data.

## A/B Testing

### Hypotheses Tested
1. **Impact of Strain on Recovery Score**:
   - **Group A**: Low strain days
   - **Group B**: High strain days
   - **Result**: No statistically significant difference in recovery scores between low and high strain days (p > 0.05).

2. **Effect of Sleep Duration on Recovery**:
   - **Group A**: Short sleep duration (below median)
   - **Group B**: Long sleep duration (above median)
   - **Result**: Significant difference in recovery scores between short and long sleep durations, with higher recovery associated with longer sleep (p < 0.05).

3. **Heart Rate Variability and Sleep Quality**:
   - **Group A**: Low HRV days
   - **Group B**: High HRV days
   - **Result**: Statistically significant difference in sleep performance, with higher HRV days associated with better sleep quality (p < 0.05).

### Statistical Methods
- **T-tests** and **Mann-Whitney U tests** were used to assess differences between groups.
- **Bonferroni Correction** was applied for multiple comparisons to maintain significance level.

## Machine Learning Models

### Models Developed
1. **Random Forest Regressor**: Used to predict recovery scores. After tuning hyperparameters, it achieved an R-squared of approximately 0.27.
2. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**: Applied to predict sleep performance. The model performed with an R-squared of approximately 0.19.

### Model Evaluation Metrics
- **R-squared**: Measures the proportion of variance explained by the model.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Used to evaluate model accuracy and error.

## Results and Insights

1. **Sleep Duration and Recovery**: Longer sleep duration has a positive impact on recovery, suggesting that athletes may benefit from increased sleep on high strain days.
2. **Strain Levels and Recovery**: No significant difference was observed in recovery scores between low and high strain days, but strain had a notable impact on sleep performance.
3. **Heart Rate Variability**: Higher HRV days correlate with better sleep quality and recovery scores, supporting HRV as a valuable metric for monitoring physiological readiness.
4. **Temperature and Recovery**: Higher body temperature was slightly correlated with lower recovery, indicating potential stress or fatigue.
