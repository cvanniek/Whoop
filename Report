# WHOOP Data Cluster Analysis Report

## **Overview**

This report presents a clustering analysis of WHOOP data collected on **sleep, recovery, and workouts**. The objective of this analysis was to identify patterns in physiological metrics that could provide insights into **optimizing training schedules and recovery strategies**.

---

## **Project Goals**

1. **Identify patterns** in recovery, sleep, and strain metrics.
2. Understand the impact of **strain and recovery** on daily performance.
3. Use clustering to inform **better training and rest day planning**.

---

## **Data Sources**

The analysis is based on three WHOOP datasets:

- **Sleep Data**: Metrics include REM sleep, deep sleep (SWS), sleep performance, and sleep debt.
- **Physiological Data**: Key metrics include recovery score, day strain, resting heart rate, and heart rate variability (HRV).
- **Workout Data**: Captures data on calories burned, time in various heart rate zones, and GPS-based activity.

---

## **Methodology**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- The three datasets were **merged** on `Cycle start time` to align daily records.
- **Missing values** were handled by dropping incomplete rows to ensure data quality.
- The features were standardized using **`StandardScaler`** for effective clustering.

### **2. Clustering with K-Means**
- **K-Means clustering** was used to group similar days based on metrics like sleep performance, day strain, and heart rate zones.
- The **optimal number of clusters** was determined using the Elbow Method, resulting in **three clusters**.

### **3. Summary Statistics and Visualization**
- Summary statistics were calculated for each cluster to identify patterns.
- **Scatter plots** were used to visualize the relationship between **recovery score** and **day strain** across clusters.

## **Results**

### **Cluster 0: Balanced Days (Optimal Recovery)**

- **Key Characteristics**:
  - **Sleep Performance**: 67.66%
  - **Recovery Score**: 66.18%
  - **Day Strain**: 15.61
  - **REM Sleep**: 85.78 minutes
  - **Average HR**: 103 bpm
  - **Calories Burned**: 392 calories

- **Interpretation**:
  - This cluster represents **recovery-focused days** with optimal REM and deep sleep, moderate strain, and lower average heart rate. These days are essential for **restoration and recovery**.

---

### **Cluster 1: High Activity Days**

- **Key Characteristics**:
  - **Sleep Performance**: 66.18%
  - **Recovery Score**: 66.18%
  - **Day Strain**: 15.77
  - **REM Sleep**: 80.28 minutes
  - **Average HR**: 119 bpm
  - **Higher time in HR Zones 2 and 3**

- **Interpretation**:
  - These days are characterized by **intense workouts**, indicated by higher heart rate and strain. They play a critical role in building endurance and strength but require **adequate recovery** afterward.

---

### **Cluster 2: High Stress Days (Low Recovery)**

- **Key Characteristics**:
  - **Sleep Performance**: 61.86%
  - **Recovery Score**: 57.86%
  - **Day Strain**: 15.50
  - **REM Sleep**: 76.43 minutes
  - **Average HR**: 145 bpm

- **Interpretation**:
  - This cluster indicates **stressful or overreaching days** with poor sleep and high heart rate, signaling **low recovery**. These days suggest the need for rest or lower-intensity activity to prevent potential burnout.

---

## **Visualizations**

- **Scatter Plot**: Recovery Score vs. Day Strain, colored by cluster.
  - Shows distinct groupings that highlight differences in recovery and strain patterns.
- **Box Plots**: Comparison of REM sleep, calories burned, and strain across clusters.
  - Provides insights into the variation of each metric within and across clusters.

---

## **Key Insights and Actionable Recommendations**

1. **Balanced Days (Cluster 0)** are crucial for maintaining long-term performance. Plan to include more of these days to sustain optimal recovery.
2. **High Activity Days (Cluster 1)** should be strategically placed in the schedule to maximize fitness gains without overloading the system.
3. **High Stress Days (Cluster 2)** indicate insufficient recovery. Monitor these days closely and consider adding rest or light activity following these days.

---

## **Next Steps**

1. **Real-Time Dashboard**:
   - Build an interactive dashboard to track metrics in real-time, making it easier to plan recovery days around high-strain days.

2. **Performance Prediction**:
   - Develop a machine learning model to predict performance based on physiological and sleep metrics, optimizing preparation for competitions.

3. **Longitudinal Analysis**:
   - Explore trends in physiological metrics over time, identifying seasonal or cyclical patterns in recovery and performance.

---

## **Conclusion**

This clustering analysis provided valuable insights into different types of training and recovery days, allowing for a more personalized approach to workout scheduling. By balancing **high activity and recovery-focused days**, this project aims to prevent burnout, optimize performance, and promote long-term well-being.
